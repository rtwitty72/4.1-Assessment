- Study the code bellow and answer the following without checking the console.
- Are the variables what they claim to be?
- What would console.log(y) and console.log(x) print? Why?
- Write you answer bellow the code.
**************************************************************************************/
(function(){
  "use strict";

  var x = "I'm a local variable";
  //console.log(y)

  function scopeThis(){
    var y = "I'm a global variable";
    console.log(x);
  }
  scopeThis();
})();
/*************************************************************************************
var x is not a local variable. It is a part of the global scope.
var y is a not a global varialble. It is a part of the local scope of scopeThis.

console.log(y) would print undefined, because it has not been declared yet.
console.log(x) would print "I'm a local variable", because it is in the global scope.

console.log(x) would print undefined because console.log was run before declaration.

Date Object
- Declare a variable 'todayIs'.

Warm up
- Study the code below. What will console.log(add) (inside the IFEE and outside) print? Why? Write your answer below.
- Do not uncomment console.log(add);

(function() {
  "use strict";
  const add = 2 + 2;

/**************************************************************************************
console.log(add) inside the IFEE would print 4, because it logs add which has been declared in the local scope.
console.log(add)outside the IFEE would print undefined, because add has not been declared in the global scope.

Scope

Object notation
- Study the code below, line by line, carefully. Keep hoisting and scope in mind.
- Add the following properties to 'benefit' using bracket notation:
  - "credit" with a value of 50.
  - "discount" with a value of 5.
- Complete the missing return statement.
- 'name' must be set to 'James' as a local variable in one of the functions. It should also change the global variable in order for the assertion to pass.
-It should return: "Hello James. Here is the status of your account. Thank you for your loyalty. You've been a member for 18 months . You next bill will reflect a $50 credit and a 5% discount going forward."
HINTS:
- Don't be overwhelmed by the length of the function. Read the instructions carefully. Read it line by line, keeping hoisting and scope in mind. You've got this.
- First fix hoisting issues.
- One of the variables is missing something.
- Are the functions being called when they are supposed to?
